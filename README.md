# Linkiba — Event Services Directory & Marketplace (Cameroon & Diaspora)
Linkiba — Event Services Directory &amp; Marketplace (Cameroon &amp; Diaspora) Built a web platform that helps clients in Cameroon and the Cameroonian diaspora quickly find, compare, and contact trusted event professionals (e.g., photographers, DJs/MCs, venues, catering, decoration, AV/lighting). 


Linkiba centralizes **category-based search**, **professional listings**, **reviews/testimonials**, and **direct messaging/contact** to reduce planning time and improve trust—especially for users organizing events remotely.  
Tech stack: **PHP, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery**. Website: [Linkiba](https://www.linkiba.com)

### Key features delivered
- **Professional directory** with detailed provider profiles (services, location, description)
- **Search & filtering** by *category* and *location* (fast discovery of nearby providers)
- **Category catalog** covering major event needs (entertainment, venues, catering, decor, AV/technical, logistics, security, attire, custom items)
- **Contact flow / messaging** to connect clients with providers directly from the platform
- **Trust layer** via **reviews/testimonials** and “featured members” highlights
- **Mobile-first UI** using Bootstrap for responsive layouts and consistent components

### What I worked on 
- Designed and implemented **PHP backend** pages/modules for listings, categories, and member profile views.
- Built dynamic UI behaviors using **jQuery + JavaScript** (filters, form validation, interactive components).
- Implemented a clean **Bootstrap** responsive interface (search, cards, navigation, onboarding CTAs).
- Structured event-service categories (including a large multi-domain catalog: entertainment, venues, catering, decor, AV, logistics, etc.) to improve discoverability.
- Improved user journey: **Search → Compare profiles → Read reviews → Contact provider**.

### Tech stack (one-line version)
